The Xata starter guides walk you through building a blog application and help you learn core Xata fundamental concepts. The guides explore framework-specific features and demonstrate how they work with Xata.

## What you will do

- Use the Xata CLI to create a database
- Define a database schema and seed the database by importing a CSV
- Generate TypeScript code with database branching
- Query and filter
- Use full-text fuzzy search

## Before you begin

Before you build your blog application, review some important concepts and set up your development environment.

### What is a serverless database platform?

A serverless database is a cloud-based database service that removes the need for users to manage the underlying servers, infrastructure, and many typical database administration tasks. You get to focus on building your application rather than managing the complexities of database infrastructure.
For more information, see [What is a serverless data platform?](/docs/concepts/serverless-data-platform).

### What is a schema?

A Xata.io schema is a JSON-based code file that defines the structure of your database. Think of it like a blueprint for your database.
For more information, see [Schema](/docs/concepts/schema).

### The Xata CLI

Before getting started, install the [Xata command line interface (CLI)](/docs/getting-started/installation), [authenticate](/docs/rest-api/authentication), and store the CLI API key locally.
You will use the Xata CLI to manage your database, schemas, and to import data directly from your command line.

Install the Xata CLI by using the following command:

<TabbedCode tabs={['Shell', 'PowerShell']}>

```sh
npm install -g @xata.io/cli
```

```sh
npm install -g '@xata.io/cli'
```

</TabbedCode>

For more information, see the [Command line interface documentation](/docs/getting-started/installation).

### Authentication

Authentication establishes a secure link between the CLI and your Xata account for database operations. If you are not yet a Xata user, the authentication process also guides you through creating a new account.

Initiate authentication by using the `xata auth login` command. After you authenticate, an API key specific to your account is generated.
The generated API key ensures communication between your CLI and the Xata databases you'll manage.

The key is stored locally on your computer. The exact storage location can vary depending on your operating system. Typically, the API key is stored in the configuration file `.config/xata/credentials`, with the following format:

```toml
[default]
apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

The CLI makes it easier to manage your database activities directly from the terminal. By authenticating the CLI and securely storing your API key locally, your database operations are protected and only authorized users can access your data.

To learn more about authentication, see the [documentation](/docs/getting-started/installation#authenticate-the-cli-to-your-account).

## Start building

Now that you understand a few basic concepts and have set up your development environment, it's time to get started building!

Get started by selecting your starter guide:
- [Astro](/docs/getting-started/astro)
- [Next.js](/docs/getting-started/nextjs)
- [Nuxt](/docs/getting-started/nuxt)
- [Remix](/docs/getting-started/remix)
- [SolidStart](/docs/getting-started/solidstart)
- [SvelteKit](/docs/getting-started/sveltekit) starter guide.

Happy building!
